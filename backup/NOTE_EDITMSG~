Removendo linha 'debug'

# Please enter the note message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the operation.
#
# We recommend that the note message has a short sentence, or try to
# transform your message in a topic. Example:
#
#   New field for Account model
#     Last access date
#
# The breakline and two-spaces indentation will be converted as follows:
#
#     - New field for Account model
#       - Last access date
#
# Thus, the note becomes easier to read, instead of using big sentences.
#
# If you still need to describe the change in one big sentence, you may
# use one-space indentation to indicates the sentence continues in the
# next line. Example:
#
#   The Account model receives a new field named "last_access_date",
#    and his value changes every sign-in made by user on website.
#
# The one-space indentation will be converted as follows:
#
#     - The Account model receives a new field named "last_access_date",
#       and his value changes every sign-in made by user on website.
#
# You can make several combinations of one-space or two-spaces indentation
# if you need. We hope this helps you to improve your release notes.
